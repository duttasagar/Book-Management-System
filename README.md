	•	pip (Python's package manager).

4. Installation Instructions
		Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the application.
		Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
		It’s a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
		python3 -m venv virtualenv
		Activate the virtual environment:
	•	On Windows:
		virtualenv/scripts/activate
		Step 2: Install Required Packages
		Install the required dependencies using pip:
		pip install fastapi uvicorn motor jinja2 pydantic
		Step 4: Set Up MongoDB
		•	Create a MongoDB Atlas account if you don’t have one already: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
	•	Create a new database cluster and get the Connection String.
	•	Replace the connection string in the code with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string:
	python
	Copy
	uri = "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster-address.mongodb.net/?	retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Bookapp"
	Make sure your database name is todo_db and the collection is book_store.
	Step 5: Run the Application
	Now you can run the application using Uvicorn.
	uvicorn main:app --reload
•	This will run the FastAPI application on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
•	The --reload flag enables automatic reloading during development.
